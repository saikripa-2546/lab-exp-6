## AIM

To understand and apply essential UX design methods such as ideation, user stories, scenarios, task flows, and information architecture. To generate diverse low-fidelity solutions using Crazy 8s/brainwriting. To analyze user needs through stories and contextual scenarios. To build structured flows and site maps for clear and effective user navigation.

## ALGORITHM

Identify a UX Problem
Select a real-world problem—for example, booking a hospital appointment.

Conduct Crazy 8s / Brainwriting
Generate eight rapid solution sketches within 8 minutes to explore multiple design directions.

Develop User Stories
Write at least five user stories based on persona needs, motivations, frustrations, and goals.

Create a Scenario
Pick one user story and write a detailed scenario describing:

Context

User behavior

Challenges

Emotional experience

Design a Task/User Flow
Choose an activity (e.g., ordering food) and map all steps in a structured task flow or user flow diagram.

Perform Card Sorting
Select any website/app and group its information into logical categories using open/closed card sorting techniques.

Build a Site Map
Based on the grouped categories, create a clear and hierarchical Information Architecture (IA) and site map.
