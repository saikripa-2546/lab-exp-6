I’ve chosen “Hospital Appointment Booking App” as the base problem (since you
mentioned it as an example).
Everything is explained in detail and formatted professionally.
1. Solution Ideation
UX Problem:
Users find it difficult to book appointments quickly in a hospital app due to confusing
navigation, overcrowded screens, and lack of clarity on available time slots.
Crazy 8’s / Brainwriting – 8 Ideas (Low Fidelity)
Idea 1 – Quick Appointment Button
 Home screen has one large “Book Appointment” button.
 Auto-detects nearest available doctor.
Idea 2 – Smart Search
 Search bar suggests doctors by symptoms (e.g., “fever → General Physician”).
Idea 3 – Calendar-First Flow
 User first sees a calendar → chooses date → app shows all available doctors for that
date.
Idea 4 – Specialty Tiles
 Big tiles: Pediatrics, ENT, Dermatology, Orthopedics, etc.
 Users tap → see available doctors → book.
Idea 5 – Voice-Based Appointment
 User speaks: “Book a dermatologist appointment tomorrow at 10 AM.”
 App shows matching slots.
Idea 6 – Doctor Comparison View
 Side-by-side comparison of fees, experience, reviews.
Idea 7 – Chatbot Appointment Helper
 Chat-style interface asking:
“What issue are you facing? When do you want to come?”
Idea 8 – Emergency Fast Track
 1-click button for emergency cases → shows nearest available doctors with shortest
waiting time.
2. Creating User Stories
Here are 5 user stories in correct format:
User Story 1
As a working professional, I want to book an appointment quickly, so that I don't waste
time navigating through the app.
User Story 2
As a first-time user, I want to search doctors by symptoms, so that I can find the right
specialist without medical knowledge.
User Story 3
As a parent, I want to view available pediatricians, so that I can choose the best doctor for
my child.
User Story 4
As a senior citizen, I want to see a simple and large interface, so that I can use the app
without confusion.
User Story 5
As a patient with chronic illness, I want to view my previously visited doctors, so that I can
easily rebook follow-up appointments.
3. Creating Scenarios (Based on User Story 1)
User Story Selected:
“As a working professional, I want to book an appointment quickly so that I don’t waste time
navigating through the app.”
Scenario Narrative
User: Rahul, 28, Software Engineer
Environment: Office desk, 10-minute break
Emotional State: Stressed, in a hurry
Rahul has been experiencing severe headaches for two days. During a short break at work,
he opens the hospital app to book an appointment. Because he has limited time, he wants
the process to be fast and simple.
He taps the Quick Appointment button on the home screen. The app shows top available
doctors for “General Physician.” Rahul selects a doctor and sees clearly displayed available
time slots. The interface is clean, with large buttons and no clutter.
He chooses a 6 PM appointment, confirms payment, and receives a notification.
Rahul feels relieved that he managed to book the appointment within two minutes and can
return to work without stress.
